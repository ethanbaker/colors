// The colors package is for terminals that support ANSI color escapes, which
// are the most efficient. Most will simply use the constants while others who
// want more control over when colors are used may choose to use the methods
// instead. Still others may prefer to code their applications to use the fast
// color constants by default and decolor content when colors are not
// supported.
